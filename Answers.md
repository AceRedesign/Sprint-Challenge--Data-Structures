1. Stack = Last in first out
   Queue = First in first out

2. Time Complexity

   linked list = O(n)
   Hash Table = O(1)
   Binary Search Tree = O(log(n))

3. You can store more complex data structures in a hash table, an array you can only use numbered indexes, but if you have a hashtable you can access indexes by string.
